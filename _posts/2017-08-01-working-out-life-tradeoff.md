### The Paradox of Exercising for Longevity

Glenn Dayton &middot; August 1, 2017

I spend on average over 3 hours per day ... **just exercising**. This includes getting dressed, taking a shower,
driving to and from the gym twice a day, and the actual exercise.

3 hours per day for 60 years is roughly **7 straight years** of sweating, panting, showering, and feeling awful. However,
on the flip side **not being obese** can extend life up to **7.2 years**  (PLoS Medicine). They seemingly cancel
each other out. *Exercise extends life, however the very act of exercise consumes the time that your life is extended by.*

What's the hack?

If you want to release stress and focus before a long day, or effortlessly walk, and have a low heart rate
and slow breathing, it's worth it. However, if you're looking to lose weight and elongate your life, a combination of
diet and exercise would be a better approach.

I'm looking at this dilemma from a philisophical point of view


3 hours of exercise per day results in **6.8 years of lifetime exercise**.



By exercising, am I really living longer or fending off possible future health complications?
