### The Paradox of Exercising for Longevity

Glenn Dayton &middot; August 1, 2017

Lately I've spend on average over 3 hours per day ... *just exercising*. This includes getting dressed, taking a shower,
driving to and from the gym twice a day, and the actual exercise.

3 hours per day for 60 years is roughly **7 straight years** of sweating, panting, showering, and feeling awful. However,
on the flip side **not being obese** can extend life up to **7.2 years**  (PLoS Medicine). They seemingly cancel
each other out. *Exercise extends life, however the very act of exercise consumes the time that your life is extended by.*

*Is it really worth exercising?*
