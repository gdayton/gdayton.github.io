### Cryptocurrency: Not a long-term Investment

{% include post/share-buttons.html %}

Glenn Dayton &middot; September 25, 2017

Any investment growing over 900% in one year, is a phenomenon rarely seen. Later, in the same space, subsequent investments making over 8,700%, 3,850%, and 14,600% over an even shorter amount of time of 6 months is even more improbable. Yet this trend of hypergrowth continues to happen in this now almost predictable pattern. Welcome to the world of cryptocurrecy.

It's not all peaches and cream. Cryptocurrencies fall as fast as they rise, Ethereum dropped from $310 to $0.10 in one day. $10,000 would have melted into barely enough to buy a coffee. Ethereum has since regained a large amount of its value and continues to follow a friendly sine wave trend. However, not all cryptocurrencies are as forgiving; Ripple, another popular coin, hasn't recovered from its peak at $0.37 currently resting nearly above $0.18.

Despite tremendous growth and enormous amounts of media attention I still stand firm in beliving that virtual currencies will never entirely replace real currencies. I'll go further and say that I belive some convertible virtual currencies are dramatically overvalued, purely because of the lack of incentive to adopt.

Bitcoin opened the act, and several years later Ethereum stole the show with its faster transactional time, and deeper xuse of blockchain technology. Who's next and what will they bring to the show that Bitcoin, and Ethereum couldn't offer? And will the competition of the best virtual currency last forever? There's now over 900 virtual currencies all competing, five times the amount of current currencies on this earth. Now imagine if virtual currency had been widely adopted, that is everyone converted their real money to virtual currency; what virtual currency out of the 900 and growing would most convert their money to? With the dollar replaced by virtual currency, overnight your retirement funds could retire before you as the battle of which 900 other and growing virtual currencies is the best. This chaos would continue until the government backs a virtual currency with gold. Yet, this government backing demolishes one of the main pillars that motivates the adoption of virtual currency: decentralization.

Another pillar that supports virtual currency is that the payer and payee can't be identified. When a transaction is made the only information shared between both parties is the to and from addresses, digital signatures, and the amount transfered. However, anonymity is a huge misconception for most that convert their real currency into virtual currency through exchanges like Coinbase, Bitpay, and more. When signing up to an exhcnage they require personal information, including bank account details, credit cards, and more to begin converting real currency into virtual currency. Effectively grouping identities with virtual currency addresses in a convenient package for the FBI to subpoena. It is possible to maintain anonymity if the virtual currency is generated locally or the virtual currency is bought through a private party, but a majority of virtual currencies are handled through a non-anonymous payment gateway.

A non-anonymous payment gateway and exchange releases the wrecking ball and obliterates the 3rd pillar of what makes virtual currencies so attractive: taxes. Virtual currency anonymity doesn't exist under most circumstances making it a very risky option to avoid paying taxes.
